README:

This library is first used for course of Network modelling and Operation research.
It includes some important data structures and algorithms such as: linked list, 
heap, shortest path algorithms, discrete event scheduling framework, etc. 

1. Discrete Event Scheduling (DES) Simulation
The framework of DES is in netsim/netsim.{h,c}. This framework helps you to 
simulate a system without writing it from scratch. To write a new DES system, 
you have just considered:
  - How to generate an event by implementing the pointer function generate_event()
  - How to process an event by implementing the pointer function process_event()
  - What is the condition of stopping simulation with pointer function allow_continue()
  - How to get next event with pointer function get_next_event()
When you finish all these functions, your simulation is nearly ready to work 
before calling function pisas_sched(). This function will start to emulate your 
system.

2. Operation research
In progressing of modifying source code.
