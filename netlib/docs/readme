README:

This library is first used for course of Network modelling and Operation research.
It includes some important data structures and algorithms such as: linked list, 
heap, shortest path algorithms, discrete event scheduling framework, etc. 

1. Discrete Event Scheduling (DES) Simulation
The framework of DES is in netsim/netsim.{h,c}. This framework helps you to 
simulate a system without writing it from scratch. To write a new DES system, 
you have just considered:
  - How to generate an event by implementing the pointer function generate_event()
  - How to process an event by implementing the pointer function process_event()
  - What is the condition of stopping simulation with pointer function allow_continue()
  - How to get next event with pointer function get_next_event()
When you finish all these functions, your simulation is nearly ready to work 
before calling function pisas_sched(). This function will start to emulate your 
system.

1.1 Using netsim to simulate queueing system (short user guide)
First, take a look at file netlib.c to modify the path of configuration file. To
be sure, you can fix this as absolute path in function check_netsim(). You can do
another way more advance, it is except to you. 
Second, modify the configuration file. If you do not change anything in netlib.c
(but need to be sure that main function call check_netsim()), you need to see the 
configuration file: netsim/conf/test.conf. In this file, there are some comments
that may help you in tuning or modifying the characteristics of simulated system.
Finally, compile and run this program (execution file name is netlib). 
Enjoy the results!

2. Operation research
In progressing of modifying source code.
